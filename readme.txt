CS 430 final project

The algorithm I used is the greedy algorithm.
My project folder has the source code file "main.c", its compiled runnable file "main" and two subfolders 
named "input" and "output_greedy" for storing instanceXX.txt input files and greedy_solutionXX.txt output files.
All source codes are in main.c, which was created and edited using IDE CLion on Windows 8.1. 
It should also work on Linux or Mac.
